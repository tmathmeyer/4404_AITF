\section{Network Design}

In Figure 1 H is an honest party participating in AITF, V is the victim, A is
the attacker, and I is an internet backbone router. Ag, Hg, and Vg are the
respective gateways for each of the Attacker, Honest party, and Victim.

In this scenario, we assume that all gateways and their clients are AITF
enabled. While this would of course break backwards compatibility with the
current architecture of the internet, we feel that it is outside the scope of
the project to attempt a backwards compatible system. A more advanced
description of the network protocol will be described later when discussing
security and vulnerabilities of the AITF protocol.

\section{Packet and Header Design}
The core component of the AITF system is the shim layer that will be inserted
between the IP header and the IP payload. In keeping with the style of RFC 791
for internet packet headers, the shim layer is specified as such:

\texttt{\lstinputlisting[basicstyle=\ttfamily\scriptsize]{ip_spec.txt}}

Based on the statistics and calculations in the [original paper], we concluded
that a minimum of six bytes are needed in order to maintain an uncrackable key.
However, six is not a very nice number (read: not a power of two), so eight
bytes were used instead. The shim layer is treated as a stack; each AITF enabled
router that sees any type of packet will do four things: \\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The router will change the protocol ID in the original IP header to
     254. This ID is reserved by RFC 791 for research use.
	\item The router will increment the shim size field in the options buffer
     in the IP header
	\item The router will write the IP address of its outgoing connection and
     the randomly generated number, which is keyed on the destination IP
     of the original IP header.
	\item The router will write the remainder of the packet
\end{enumerate}
Clients such as V, H, and A will also strip the AITF shim layer by calculating
its size from the options header. This information will have to be stored in a
key-value pair structure, such that paths can be retrieved by source IP on
request.


\section{Network Communication Logic Design}
\begin{figure}[h!]
 \caption{basic network design}

\end{figure}
A basic attack which AITF is designed to combat is a simple flooding attack, as
shown in figure [2]. In this scenario, the attacker “A” sends a large amount of
data to the victim “V”. The AITF enabled routers Ag and Vg have attached their
respective headers to the AITF shim layer. The victim determines if it is being
attacked by keeping track of the number of packets it has received from each IP
address per minute. If this number increases above a specified threshold, then
this IP address is determined to be an attacker. 

As the policy controller, V decides that A is attacking him, and decides to
issue a “please protect me”, or PPM packet to the first network in the shim
stack, or Ag. A threeway handshake between V, Ag, and Vg occurs to verify that
the PPM packet is coming from the source it is claiming to protect. The victim
will send a packet containing an IP payload of a 64 bit nonce, and with the
protocol field set to 253. Ag will intercept this packet and can verify two
things: that the nonce is correct, and that the shim layers match (recall that
Vg caches shim stacks by source IP). In the case that the nonces don’t match,
Vg will escalate. In the case that the nonces match, but the shim layers do not
match, Vg will escalate directly to the first matching layer in the shim stack.
If both match, Vg will reply with the second nonce in the reply from Ag and ask
Ag to filter traffic from A to V. If Ag cooperates, it will install a filter
for T-long seconds to filter traffic between A and V. If Ag does not cooperate,
then V will repeat this process, signifying that it wants an escalation. Vg
will then attempt to have the gateway of Ag block traffic. 


\section{Escalation}
In the case that the attacker gateway or subsequent gateways do not comply, the
request to block traffic will be escalated to gateways closer to the victim. As
the request gets escalated further and further, more traffic will be blocked.
Escalation is determined by an escalation policy implemented by the victim.
This policy ultimately chooses whether or not to escalate based on the benefit
and cost of performing that escalation. For this project, we will assume that
escalation is always beneficial, and therefore escalation will always occur
when an gateway does not comply. This benefit comes from the assumption that
most of the incoming traffic is from an attacker. This will continue up to the
victim gateway and will ultimately disconnect the victim from the internet if
no gateway complies with the filtering request. Initially the victim gateway
will put a filter for the attacking path in its TCAM memory. It will then ask
the attacker gateway to temporarily filter traffic on the attacking path. At
this point, the filter in the victim gateway’s TCAM memory will be moved to
shadow memory. If the victim receives a single packet from the attacker after
initially complaining, the victim will send a request (“whine”) to the victim
gateway communicating that it’s still receiving undesired flow. This “whine”
packet should be different than the original blocking request. This packet will
make the IP protocol header 255 If the victim gateway receives a “whine”
packet, it checks shadow memory to confirm that it already tried to resolve the
issue with the attacker gateway. The victim gateway will communicate to the
attacker gateway to filter traffic to the victim.

\section{Spoofing Attacks and their Remediation}
Suppose that in figure [1], the attacker is actually Ag and the attacker is
spoofing packets from H. Ag does this by falsifying a shim stack layer from Hg,
before sending the packet to I, which will then sign it and pass it along to
Vg. Assuming this traffic is detected as a malicious and V decides to block it,
It will route back through Ag and I, before Hg will identify the packet as
being spoofed. This is where the random number becomes important; Hg can tell
detect a mismatch in hash function output and determine that it is spoofed. If
this is the case; It will notify V of an attempted spoofing attack coming
through router I, at which point V determines if it should escalate.

\section{Definitions}
\begin{description}
	\item[Shadow Memory] This is a slower form of memory than TCAM and is used
	to store information that does not need to be accessed in a timely manner
	\item[TCAM Memory] Ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) is a type of
	high-speed memory that searches it’s contents in one clock cycle
	(similar to cache memory)
	\item[Attacking Path] The network path from the attacker to the victim
	\item[AITF] Active Internet Traffic Filtering
\end{description}

\section{Implementation}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We will use a systems language, most likely C
	\item There will be a threshold for determining whether an attack is a DOS
	attack. This threshold will be kept in /etc/aitf.d/threshold.conf as a
	number of requests per IP per minute.
	\item We will use netfilter and iptables to intercept, modify and forward
	packets.

\end{enumerate}




\section{Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The victim and attacker are AITF enabled
	\item All end hosts are AITF enabled
	\item When a victim is being attacked, most incoming traffic is from an
	attacker. Therefore, escalation is always preferred over not escalating.
	\item Not all middle routers must be AITF enabled; however if a middle
	router is not AITF enabled, escalation may not occur TO that device,
	just over it.
\end{enumerate}
